Groovy fundamentals:
		Java is more than a language
		why groovy
		installing the groovy
		working with groovy
		
		
java ---> helps in working with server side architecture.
platform:
		scala, groovy are alternatively for JVM 
		
		
Groovy :
		-> dynamic language
		-> complies to JVM bytecode
		-> brings the advanced concepts to jvm
		-> has mature IDE support ()
		
What are dynamic languages?
		1. Java is a static language
		2. illsuited to work with flexible data format
	Groovy is a dynamic language:
		1. More suitable for run time
		2. help in more rapid development
		3. helps to work with felxible data- format
		4. language type-system. 
		5. careful with bugs
		6. performance is slower
strongly and weakly typed:
		1. not allow inapproriate operations on an object
		
 Polyglot programming:
 
 
compile the groovy script -> groovyc cmd


IDEs for groovy:
		eclipse
		
gstring: $


Range in groovy:
		1 ..
		2. Enum
each method in groovy:
findAll()

dynamic capabiliteies in groovy:
		1. gives the automatic datatypes by using def keyword
		
duck typing:
 the type is assigned at the run time rather than the comiple time
 
 duck typing is extremely power-full
 unit testing is very important.
 
 advance collection handling than java and functional typing
 
 

groovy with XML:
	dependency 
	
	GPX data -> xml format for exchange GPS data
	 syntax: 
	 <? xml version ="1.0.9" standalone = "yes"?>
	 <gpx>
		<name></name>										-> metadata elements{CDATA}
		<description></description>
		
		<wpt></wpt>  - > waypoint which describes the latitudes ,longitudes, elevation, timestamp
		
		<rte>
			<rtept></rept> -> route points
		</rte>
		
		
	 </gpx>

Reading XML:
		DOMCategory
		xmlParser
			eager evaluation
		XMLSlurper - > reads the xml file
